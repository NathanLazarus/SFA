\begin_layout Title
Factor Apportionment and Price Distortions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Nathan Lazarus and Ian Sapollnik
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
We study the extent to which firms adjust prices and wages in response to
 incentives created by corporate tax apportionment formulas.
 When jurisdictions use formulary apportionment and have heterogeneous tax
 rates, this creates an incentive for firms to distort the prices of the
 factors used in the apportionment formulas.
 In the case of sales factor apportionment, this entails charging higher
 prices and selling lower quantities in high tax jurisdictions, increasing
 the share of sales revenue in low tax jurisdictions.
 A similar incentive exists for wages in the case of payroll factors in
 apportionment formulas if labour supply to the firm is not perfectly inelastic.
 We propose empirical designs to estimate how fully firms respond to this
 incentive.
 Then we outline a structural model that we will use to study optimal apportionm
ent formulas and compare the welfare implications of shifting international
 corporate taxes from a system of separate accounting to formulary apportionment.

\begin_layout Section
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When firms produce and operate in multiple jurisdictions, governments must
 determine how to tax overall profits while avoiding double taxation.
 A fundamental problem in doing so is that while revenue can easily be observed
 at a regional level in a firm's books, profits generally can not.
 Under the current international corporate tax regime of separate accounting
 in which firms report value added by location, firms have been able to
 avoid massive tax liabilities by offshoring profits to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tax havens
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, countries with no corporate tax rate.
 Recently, there has been increased focus on this issue in the context of
 international taxation, with the OECD developing an Inclusive Framework
 on Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS), focused around two pillars.
 The first is a shift away from separate accounting and towards sales factor
 apportionment, in which the share of sales occurring in a jurisdiction
 determine the share of world profits the firm is liable to pay.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the United States, state corporate taxes have been assessed using apportionme
nt formulae for some time.
 Most states utilized factor apportionment formulas that rely on the location
 of payroll, property and sales to determine a multi-state firm's liabilities
 in their state, though in recent years there has been a large shift to
 only apportioning based on the sales factor.
 As of 2022, 32 states rely solely on sales in apportioning corporate income
 tax liabilities.
 A further 9 states place more than a 50% weight on sales in their apportionment
 formulas, while just 6 states continue to use three factor formulas.

\begin_layout Standard
This note presents a simple fact about factor apportionment rules: when
 there is regional heterogeneity in tax rates and firms have monopoly power,
 it is optimal for firms to raise prices in high-tax regions.
 This will push prices above the monopolist's optimal price in the absence
 of apportionment.
 While these elevated prices lower demand and thus revenue in the high-tax
 region, this loss can be more than offset by the gains from paying fewer
 taxes on the inframarginal units that are still sold.
 Similarly, as has been previously documented, payroll factor apportionment
 rules have the tendency to reduce employment in higher tax regions.
 We further show that when firms have monopsony power, the margin of adjustment
 can be the wages paid to employees rather than employment.
 In particular, higher tax states see lower wages when taxes are apportioned
 via payroll factors.

Related Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most related paper to this project is Fajgelbaum, Morales, Suárez Serrato
 and Zidar (2019), who study the overall spatial misallocation induced by
 heterogeneity in state tax rates and rules.
 While not central to their results, these authors make a similar theoretical
 point, namely that monopolistic firms will distort prices to be higher
 in higher-tax jurisdictions.
 Beyond this, there is a large literature examining the structural impacts
 of apportionment rules in the United States on a wide range of economic
 outcomes.
 Gordon and Wilson (1986) were the first to examine the incentive structures
 created by three factor apportionment, arguing that many perverse incentives
 induced by apportionment can be eliminated with separate accounting.
 They focus primarily on payroll and property; they mention in passing a
 similar price effect, but focus their discussion of sales factor apportionment
 on

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Cross-hauling is an effect where, in a three factor system, a firm that
 is located in a high tax jurisdiction is more averse to selling in a high
 tax jurisdiction because taxes there have a larger effect on retained profits,
 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\tau$
\end_inset

, because 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is larger.
 It seems like in practice this would be very small in magnitude.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 McLure (1981) suggests that the corporate tax is essentially a tax on the
 underlying factors used in apportionment formulas.
 He further makes the point that the incidence of such taxes rests primarily
 on residents of the taxing state, a position which we somewhat contradict
 by pointing out that a change in tax rates or formulas in one state can
 alter wages and prices in another.
 Goolsbee and Maydew (2000) document that the inclusion of payroll in apportionm
ent formulae lead to large changes in employment across states, but have
 a zero net effect on aggregate employment.
 Suárez Serrato and Zidar (2016) use variation in apportionment rules to
 identify the incidence of corporate tax cuts across firms, workers and
 landowners.
 Giroud and Rauh (2019) study how businesses reallocate activity with changes
 in tax rates, using similar variation in apportionment rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a large theoretical literature focused on tax competition
 in formulary apportionment and separate accounting systems.
 Riedel and Runkel (2007) construct such a game where some countries choose
 separate accounting and others formulary apportionment.
 The biggest downside of separate accounting is the phenomenon of transfer
 pricing, in which firms manipulate input costs to gain tax advantages.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Separate accounting can also lead to some inefficient trade.
 Suppose a firm produces in a high cost, high price, high tax jurisdiction
 and a low cost, low price, low tax jurisdiction.
 Under separate accounting, it's optimal to sell the goods produced in the
 high tax jurisdiction in the low tax jurisdiction, so that the subsidiary
 in the high tax jurisdiction has low or no profits, while all the profits
 are earned by the subsidiary in the low tax jurisdiction.
 This can lead to wasteful trade in the presence of trade costs.

 The challenge in this literature is to get interior solutions with separate
 accounting, where firms engage in some tax avoidance but do not report
 that 100% of their profits are earned in Bermuda.
 Riedel and Runkel, and other papers in this literature, use a convex cost
 of concealment of the true location of profits to generate interior solutions
 for evasion, which is what we propose to do as well in our structural model.

\begin_layout Section
Basic Framework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A monopolistic firm operates in two locations, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2$
\end_inset

.
 In each region, there is isoelastic demand for the good 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i}\left(p_{i}\right)=\kappa_{i}p_{i}^{-\varepsilon_{i}}$
\end_inset

.
 The good is produced using the production technology 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\ell_{1}^{\alpha}+\ell_{2}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the good is produced only with labour from both regions with identical
 production technologies in all regions.
 The firm faces no transport costs between the two regions.
 By market clearing, 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{1}\left(p_{1}\right)+D_{2}\left(p_{2}\right)=\ell_{1}^{\alpha}+\ell_{2}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 The firm pays wage 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 per unit of labour, determined exogenously, so that total pre-tax profits
 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=p_{1}q_{1}+p_{2}q_{2}-w_{1}\ell_{1}-w_{2}\ell_{2}.$
\end_inset

 The firm chooses prices and labour to maximize post-tax profits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first consider the case of separate accounting, which is how international
 corporate taxes are implemented.
 The firm's problem is then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\underset{p_{1,}p_{2}}{\max} & \left(1-\tau_{1}\right)\pi_{1}+\left(1-\tau_{2}\right)\pi_{2}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Then we explore four possible apportionment rules, where the firm faces
 corporate tax rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}\left(p_{i},\ell_{i},t_{i}\right)=s\left(p_{i},\ell_{i}\right)\times t_{i}$
\end_inset

 in each region 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 The rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}$
\end_inset

 is applied to the firm's total profits in all regions.
 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(p_{i},\ell_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

 determines the share of total profits apportioned to region 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the local tax rate set by policymakers.
 The firm maximizes post-tax profits
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\underset{p_{1,}p_{2}}{\max} & \left(1-\tau_{1}-\tau_{2}\right)\pi
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider a 100% sales factor apportionment rule, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}\left(p_{i},\ell_{i},t_{i}\right)=\frac{p_{i}q_{i}}{p_{i}q_{i}+p_{-i}q_{-i}}t_{i}$
\end_inset

, which is the system that currently exists in most U.S.
 states.
 We also look at a 100% payroll factor apportionment rule, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}\left(p_{i},\ell_{i},t_{i}\right)=\frac{w_{i}\ell_{i}}{w_{i}\ell_{i}+w_{-i}\ell_{-i}}t_{i}$
\end_inset

 with an exogenous wage and no monopsony power, and a 50/50 sales and payroll
 apportionment rule, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}\left(p_{i},\ell_{i},t_{i}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{p_{i}q_{i}}{p_{i}q_{i}+p_{-i}q_{-i}}+\frac{w_{i}\ell_{i}}{w_{i}\ell_{i}+w_{-i}\ell_{-i}}\right)t_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, we also examine the full payroll apportionment rule in the presence
 of monopsony power.
 Each of the subsections below outlines a preliminary analysis of the firm's
 problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present a simple case with two regions.
 Throughout, we set 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}=0.2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{1}=\kappa_{2}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}=w_{2}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{1}=\varepsilon_{2}=6$
\end_inset

.
 The objective is to examine what happens to relative prices, labour demand
 and quantities, when the tax in region 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 moves from zero to 0.4, while holding the tax in region 2, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}$
\end_inset

, fixed at 0.2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Separate Accounting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under separate accounting, the firm is taxed on in profits derived from
 each region.
 The firm can choose whether to sell goods produced in region 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 in any region of its choice 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

; the cost of transporting a good produced in 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, an iceberg trade cost, is assumed to be 0.
 The firm solves the problem 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\underset{p_{1},p_{2},\ell_{1},\ell_{2},q_{i}^{j}}{\max} & \left(1-t_{1}\right)\left(p_{1}q_{1}^{1}+p_{2}q_{2}^{1}-\ell_{1}w_{1}\right)+\left(1-t_{2}\right)\left(p_{1}q_{1}^{2}+p_{2}q_{2}^{2}-\ell_{2}w_{2}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

subject to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}+q_{2}^{1}=\ell_{1}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}+q_{2}^{2}=\ell_{2}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}+q_{1}^{2}=\kappa_{1}p_{1}^{-\varepsilon_{1}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{2}^{1}+q_{2}^{2}=\kappa_{2}p_{2}^{-\varepsilon_{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}^{j}\geq0$
\end_inset

.

Suppose that instead of a fixed wage

 in each region, the firm chooses the wage and faces a labour supply curve
 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{i}\left(w_{i}\right)=cw_{i}^{\rho}$
\end_inset

.
 It then solves the problem 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}

 We set labour supply elasticity,

 Similarly to when wages were fixed, relative prices and quantities are
 equal across regions, with labour decreasing as tax rates increase.
 However, we can also see that wages fall in region 1 and rise in region
 2 as the tax rate rises.

Empirical Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal is to develop a more fully fledged model of this phenomenon and
 take the model to the data to determine whether firms vary prices and wages
 in response to the incentives we document from these apportionment rules.
 We will exploit variation in apportionment rules and tax rates as in Suárez
 Serrato and Zidar (2016) and Giroud and Rauh (2019).
 We require data on prices set by firms that operate in multiple states
 and have at least some amount of market power, and the ability to easily
 change their prices.
 In particular, it is essential that the firm does not use uniform pricing
 across the country (as Gentzkow and DellaVigna (2019) document for retail
 firms).
 Some preliminary idea for data sources are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
gas stations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
fast food chain restaurants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
personal income tax preparation services
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
supermarkets, using Nielsen scanner data (worried about uniform price setting)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For wages, we have looked at data from Burning Glass and Glassdoor; which
 are posted wages in job ads and worker reports of wages, respectively.
 But it is difficult to identify multi-state employers in this data, especially
 given franchising.
 The LEHD data uses state unemployment insurance accounts to identify firms,
 and so, while it is a multi-state panel, it is not possible to link firms
 across states.
 Social Security Administration data would be ideal.
 Focusing on price distortions from sales factor apportionment, the ideal
 data set would be a panel of firms in a common industry, with each observation
 being a unique firm in a location in a given year.
 The panel would need to be complete, meaning that we require data from
 all locations in which a firm is operating.
 Data going as far back as 1980 would be ideal, as there was larger variation
 in US states' corporate tax rules in the 1980s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We plan to do an event study around the change in apportionment rules to
 see if prices adjust.
 An important challenge is that the extent of price and wage adjustment
 that is optimal is determined by the elasticity of demand (or elasticity
 of labor supply, in the case of wages).
 If demand is perfectly elastic, there's no scope for price adjustment (the
 case of perfect competition), whereas if demand is very inelastic prices
 can move a lot to game the tax rules.
 We could take an elasticity of demand from the IO literature, but if that
 is an underestimate we might say that firms are not shifting prices by
 as much as is optimal, when in fact demand is just more elastic.
 So really we can test joint hypothesis about demand and the price adjustment
 response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The naive event study specification is to focus on firms that operate within
 a state that changed its tax rate or apportionment formula, and to, for
 instance, examine whether prices in a state rise in response to tax rate
 increases.
 But there's another, potentially cleaner source of variation we can use:
 consider a firm that operates in Massachusetts and Vermont, and another
 firm that operates in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
 If all states use sales factor apportionment, in response to a decrease
 in the tax rate in New Hampshire, the Massachusetts establishments of the
 firm that operates in New Hampshire should raise prices while the Massachusetts
 establishments of the firm that doesn't operate in New Hampshire should
 keep prices constant.

\begin_layout Subsection
Sketch of Structural Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also structurally estimate the model described above if we add in
 a parameter describing whether firms are naive or sophisticated about the
 incentives created by apportionment formulas.
 After a tax change, firms' perceived tax rates are 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tau}_{i,t+1}\left(p_{i,t+1},\ell_{i,t+1},t_{i,t+1},p_{i,t},\ell_{i,t},t_{i,t}\right)=\left[\gamma s\left(p_{i,t+1},\ell_{i,t+1}\right)+\left(1-\gamma\right)s\left(p_{i,t},\ell_{i,t}\right)\right]\times t_{i}$
\end_inset

, where if 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=1$
\end_inset

, the firm is sophisticated about apportionment rules, but if 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0$
\end_inset

, the firm assumes that the apportionment factors will be held constant
 at their previous levels no matter its actions.
 Then, given a fixed elasticity of demand, we can simply choose the value
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 that minimizes the squared deviations between predicted and actual price
 changes.
 The issue with such an approach is that limited price adjustment is also
 a prediction of menu cost models; high menu costs would make it seem as
 though firms are naive, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0$
\end_inset

.
 We hope to in the future write down a more full structural model that attempts
 to predict prices in levels instead of just predicting changes, has menu
 costs, and uses demand instruments instead of an exogenous elasticity.

\begin_layout Subsection
Welfare Calculations and Optimal Apportionment Formulas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then we want to take use estimate of pricing and wage responses to do welfare
 calculations, accounting for the distortions involved in various potential
 systems of international corporate taxation.
 To do these welfare calculations, we will also lean heavily on the existing
 estimates of corporate tax incidence from Suárez Serrato and Zidar, but
 augment them with the distortions we measure and outline.
 It seems like the reasons U.S.
 states use formulary apportionment while international corporate taxes
 use separate accounting is that it is harder to determine the location
 of costs and easier to manipulate transfer prices within U.S.
 states than internationally.
 So we will follow the literature in using a convex cost of transfer price
 manipulation to pin down the extent of evasion under separate accounting
 and also account for the inefficient trade occurring under separate accounting
 discussed in Section 2.
 But we are also interested in testing the widespread intuition that sales
 factor apportionment is more efficient and less distortionary than payroll
 apportionment, and considering whether payroll apportionment should play
 a role in international corporate taxation.
