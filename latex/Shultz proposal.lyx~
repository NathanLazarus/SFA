\begin_layout Title
Factor Apportionment and Price Distortions Shultz Proposal

\begin_layout Section
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When firms produce and operate in multiple jurisdictions, governments must
 determine how to tax overall profits while avoiding double taxation.
 A fundamental problem in doing so is that while revenue can easily be observed
 at a regional level in a firm's books, profits generally can not.
 Under the current international corporate tax regime of separate accounting
 in which firms report value added by location, firms have been able to
 avoid massive tax liabilities by offshoring profits to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

tax havens
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, countries with no corporate tax rate.
 Recently, there has been increased focus on this issue in the context of
 international taxation, with the OECD developing an Inclusive Framework
 on Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS), focused around two pillars.
 The first is a shift away from separate accounting and towards sales factor
 apportionment, in which the share of sales occurring in a jurisdiction
 determine the share of world profits the firm is liable to pay.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the United States, state corporate taxes have been assessed using apportionme
nt formulae for some time.
 Most states utilized factor apportionment formulas that rely on the location
 of payroll, property and sales to determine a multi-state firm's liabilities
 in their state, though in recent years there has been a large shift to
 only apportioning based on the sales factor.
 As of 2022, 32 states rely solely on sales in apportioning corporate income
 tax liabilities.
 A further 9 states place more than a 50% weight on sales in their apportionment
 formulas, while just 6 states continue to use three factor formulas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This note presents a simple fact about factor apportionment rules: when
 there is regional heterogeneity in tax rates and firms have monopoly power,
 it is optimal for firms to raise prices in high-tax regions.
 This will push prices above the monopolist's optimal price in the absence
 of apportionment.
 While these elevated prices lower demand and thus revenue in the high-tax
 region, this loss can be more than offset by the gains from paying fewer
 taxes on the inframarginal units that are still sold.
 Similarly, as has been previously documented, payroll factor apportionment
 rules have the tendency to reduce employment in higher tax regions.
 We further show that when firms have monopsony power, the margin of adjustment
 can be the wages paid to employees rather than employment.
 In particular, higher tax states see lower wages when taxes are apportioned
 via payroll factors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Basic Framework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A monopolistic firm operates in two locations, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2$
\end_inset

.
 In each region, there is isoelastic demand for the good 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i}\left(p_{i}\right)=\kappa_{i}p_{i}^{-\varepsilon_{i}}$
\end_inset

.
 The good is produced using the production technology 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\ell_{1}^{\alpha}+\ell_{2}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the good is produced only with labour from both regions with identical
 production technologies in all regions.
 The firm faces no transport costs between the two regions.
 By market clearing, 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{1}\left(p_{1}\right)+D_{2}\left(p_{2}\right)=\ell_{1}^{\alpha}+\ell_{2}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 The firm pays wage 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 per unit of labour, determined exogenously, so that total pre-tax profits
 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=p_{1}q_{1}+p_{2}q_{2}-w_{1}\ell_{1}-w_{2}\ell_{2}.$
\end_inset

 The firm chooses prices and labour to maximize post-tax profits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first consider the case of separate accounting, which is how international
 corporate taxes are implemented.
 The firm's problem is then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\underset{p_{1,}p_{2}}{\max} & \left(1-\tau_{1}\right)\pi_{1}+\left(1-\tau_{2}\right)\pi_{2}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Then we explore four possible apportionment rules, where the firm faces
 corporate tax rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}\left(p_{i},\ell_{i},t_{i}\right)=s\left(p_{i},\ell_{i}\right)\times t_{i}$
\end_inset

 in each region 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 The rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}$
\end_inset

 is applied to the firm's total profits in all regions.
 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(p_{i},\ell_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

 determines the share of total profits apportioned to region 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the local tax rate set by policymakers.
 The firm maximizes post-tax profits
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\underset{p_{1,}p_{2}}{\max} & \left(1-\tau_{1}-\tau_{2}\right)\pi
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider a 100% sales factor apportionment rule, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}\left(p_{i},\ell_{i},t_{i}\right)=\frac{p_{i}q_{i}}{p_{i}q_{i}+p_{-i}q_{-i}}t_{i}$
\end_inset

, which is the system that currently exists in most U.S.
 states.
 We also look at a 100% payroll factor apportionment rule, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}\left(p_{i},\ell_{i},t_{i}\right)=\frac{w_{i}\ell_{i}}{w_{i}\ell_{i}+w_{-i}\ell_{-i}}t_{i}$
\end_inset

 with an exogenous wage and no monopsony power, and a 50/50 sales and payroll
 apportionment rule, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}\left(p_{i},\ell_{i},t_{i}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{p_{i}q_{i}}{p_{i}q_{i}+p_{-i}q_{-i}}+\frac{w_{i}\ell_{i}}{w_{i}\ell_{i}+w_{-i}\ell_{-i}}\right)t_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, we also examine the full payroll apportionment rule in the presence
 of monopsony power.
 Each of the subsections below outlines a preliminary analysis of the firm's
 problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present a simple case with two regions.
 Throughout, we set 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}=0.2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{1}=\kappa_{2}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}=w_{2}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{1}=\varepsilon_{2}=6$
\end_inset

.
 The objective is to examine what happens to relative prices, labour demand
 and quantities, when the tax in region 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 moves from zero to 0.4, while holding the tax in region 2, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}$
\end_inset

, fixed at 0.2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Separate Accounting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under separate accounting, the firm is taxed on in profits derived from
 each region.
 The firm can choose whether to sell goods produced in region 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 in any region of its choice 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

; the cost of transporting a good produced in 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, an iceberg trade cost, is assumed to be 0.
 The firm solves the problem 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\underset{p_{1},p_{2},\ell_{1},\ell_{2},q_{i}^{j}}{\max} & \left(1-t_{1}\right)\left(p_{1}q_{1}^{1}+p_{2}q_{2}^{1}-\ell_{1}w_{1}\right)+\left(1-t_{2}\right)\left(p_{1}q_{1}^{2}+p_{2}q_{2}^{2}-\ell_{2}w_{2}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

subject to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}+q_{2}^{1}=\ell_{1}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}+q_{2}^{2}=\ell_{2}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}+q_{1}^{2}=\kappa_{1}p_{1}^{-\varepsilon_{1}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{2}^{1}+q_{2}^{2}=\kappa_{2}p_{2}^{-\varepsilon_{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}^{j}\geq0$
\end_inset

.

\end{align*}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Section
Empirical Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal is to develop a more fully fledged model of this phenomenon and
 take the model to the data to determine whether firms vary prices and wages
 in response to the incentives we document from these apportionment rules.
 We will exploit variation in apportionment rules and tax rates as in Suárez
 Serrato and Zidar (2016) and Giroud and Rauh (2019).
 We require data on prices set by firms that operate in multiple states
 and have at least some amount of market power, and the ability to easily
 change their prices.
 In particular, it is essential that the firm does not use uniform pricing
 across the country.
 We plan to focus on the specific case of gas stations, which tend to be
 owned by large multi-state firms, have low menu costs, and have strong
 regional variation in pricing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We plan to do an event study around the change in apportionment rules to
 see if prices adjust.
 An important challenge is that the extent of price and wage adjustment
 that is optimal is determined by the elasticity of demand (or elasticity
 of labor supply, in the case of wages).
 If demand is perfectly elastic, there's no scope for price adjustment (the
 case of perfect competition), whereas if demand is very inelastic prices
 can move a lot to game the tax rules.
 We could take an elasticity of demand from the IO literature, but if that
 is an underestimate we might say that firms are not shifting prices by
 as much as is optimal, when in fact demand is just more elastic.
 So really we can test joint hypothesis about demand and the price adjustment
 response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The naive event study specification is to focus on firms that operate within
 a state that changed its tax rate or apportionment formula, and to, for
 instance, examine whether prices in a state rise in response to tax rate
 increases.
 But there's another, potentially cleaner source of variation we can use:
 consider a firm that operates in Massachusetts and Vermont, and another
 firm that operates in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
 If all states use sales factor apportionment, in response to a decrease
 in the tax rate in New Hampshire, the Massachusetts establishments of the
 firm that operates in New Hampshire should raise prices while the Massachusetts
 establishments of the firm that doesn't operate in New Hampshire should
 keep prices constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Budget
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We plan to use the Shultz funding to make data purchases from Oil Price
 Information Service (OPIS), which has historical data on gas prices and
 sales volume at the gas station level going back to 2007.
 Gas prices are a particularly good context to study because they change
 with a high frequency; for other goods we worry that menu costs and frictions
 around changing prices might lead us not to observe an effect on prices.
 We have a quote with OPIS for $29,000 firm by quarter by state data on
 gas prices that we would use, but we are currently negotiating with them
 for a lower price for firm by quarter by year data and for fewer years.
 We are asking for $11,000 in funding from the Shultz fund, allocated as
 $8,000 towards Ian's limit and $3,000 towards Nathan's limit.
